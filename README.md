Shifting Elasmobranch Community Assemblage at an Isolated Marine Protected Area
=====

This repository contains R scripts for analyses desribed in White et al (2014) (paper in submission). The data are not available online as they are owned by the Undersea Dive Company. Please contact Easton White (eawhite@ucdavis.edu) for more information. 

The R scripts were used to assess trends in abundance of twelve different elasmobranch (shark and ray) species at Cocos Island, Costa Rica. The scripts use the glmmadmb package to assess trends using a generalized mixed modeling framework.
